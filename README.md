# Fleet-Management

Fleet Management is the systematic operation of all the transporting components in a company. All companies that have a fleet of vehicles as a part of their business model should have a well designed system. Tracking the location and condition of the vehicles, maintenance schedules, and fuel usage helps manage costs and keeps the equipment working longer. In this project we look at the use of Reinforced Learning, specifically the DQN algorithm in optimizing a Fleet Management System.
